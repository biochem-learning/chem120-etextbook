While this may sound kind of simple, and maybe a little boring, hydrocarbons are actually an interesting and important class of compounds. They make up the bulk of crude oil, which is refined into gasoline, diesel fuel, and jet fuel, and from which many of the chemicals used in chemical research are derived. Many plastics are also hydrocarbons, including high-density polyethylene (2), low-density polyethylene (4), polypropylene (5), and polystyrene (6). The number of different hydrocarbon compounds is literally more than the number of stars in the sky."

Alkanes are compounds of carbon and hydrogen that contain only single bonds. Alkenes are hydrocarbons that contain one or more carbon-to-carbon double bonds. Alkenes may also have some carbon-to-carbon single bonds. In other words, it is not necessary for there to be only carbon-to-carbon double bonds for a compound to be considered an alkene. Alkynes are like alkenes except they have at least one carbon-to-carbon triple bond instead of double bonds."

            "content": "The naming of organic compounds is done systematically. The name comes directly from the structure and tells us exactly how all the atoms in the structure are connected. Consequently, names can oftentimes be complex. Understanding the system we use for naming helps us understand structure. One important skill in naming an organic compound is identifying the longest chain of carbon atoms. Names have meaning; they tell us what the structure is. Think about it this way: if your name had to describe to people all they need to know to understand who you are, it would be a very long name! Let's consider an example. Likely, many of us are familiar with ibuprofen, which is also known as Advil, Midol, Motrin, and several other names. If I say I took some ibuprofen, you would probably understand that I had a headache or some other pain, and I took the ibuprofen to relieve that pain. In that way, the name tells us something important about what it is. However, a chemist might very well want to know more about ibuprofen than that name can tell us. Chemists are interested in the structure of the compound because the structure tells us much that can help us understand how ibuprofen interacts with the body and produces its pain-relieving effect. So chemists might use the name (R,S)-2-[4-(2-methylpropyl)phenyl]propanoic acid. Quite a long and complicated name, to be sure, but to someone trained in organic chemistry, it allows us to write the structure and, from that, understand quite a bit about ibuprofen."

            "content": "We'll start with nomenclature in the simplest way. The first thing we look for when naming an organic compound is the longest chain or ring of carbon atoms. This longest chain (or ring) becomes the parent structure, and the parent name tells us two key pieces of information: the length of the longest carbon chain (indicated by a prefix) and the type of bonds and functional groups present in that chain (indicated by a suffix). Now that we know what alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes are, we can start by naming alkanes. The end of the name is going to be “ane.” Before that, we'll put a prefix to indicate the length of the longest carbon chain. So, for example, the compound with 5 carbons in a chain is called pentane - pent to indicate 5 carbons and 'ane' to indicate it is an alkane. Unfortunately, all of the prefixes we used to indicate chain length are not as easy to remember as pent. The hardest are the first four, as you can see in this table."

Either the ring will be the parent, or the ring will be a substituent. The ring will never be part of a chain of carbons. The ring will be the parent if it has more carbon atoms than any carbon chain in the rest of the molecule, or it contains a functional group. The ring will be a substituent if it has fewer carbons than a chain in the rest of the molecule or if the chain contains a functional group. To name a ring as the parent, we put 'cyclo' in front of the normal parent name. So a ring of 5 carbons is cyclopentane, and a ring of 6 carbons with a double bond is cyclohexene."
