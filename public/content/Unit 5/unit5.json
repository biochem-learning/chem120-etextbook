For instance, Alice Ball, who discovered a treatment for leprosy, had her work stolen and published by her male colleagues. Similarly, Dr. Percy Julian, a graduate of DePauw University, encountered numerous challenges and institutionalized barriers in his scientific pursuits. Yet, Dr. Julian still received more than 130 patents. Asima Chatterjee made significant contributions to natural product chemistry even though she had to purchase her own chemicals and glassware."

The more advanced the degree the higher the percentage of white people receiving them. Of course, this means non-white people receive those degrees to a lesser degree. The disparities mostly show up in changes in percentages for Hispanic or Latino people."
